	<h1>Research Question</h1>
	<br />
	<p>The price of tuition in the U.S. has remained fairly steep over the years. Between the 1983-84 and 2013-14 academic years, inflation-adjusted tuition increased by 153% at private four-year colleges and 231% at public four-year universities <a href="https://ww.collegeboard.org">(College Board)</a>. Tuition costs play a major factor in deciding which college to attend, especially for students from low-income families. While private universities are traditionally thought to be more expensive, with their high tuition, recent deep cuts in state funding for public institions has contributed to rising tuition among state universities. The average state is spending 20% less per student in 2015 compared to 2008 <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/" target="blank"> (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities)</a>. In this project, I examine the trends in tuition prices and post-undergraduate debt between 4-year private (non-profit) and public universities. I also examine among public universities if the changes in tuition fees are caused by changes in government funding. I hope that my conclusions can shed light on the factors of increased tuition and fees, as well as provide insight on the financial discrepancies/similarities between public and private universities. </p>
